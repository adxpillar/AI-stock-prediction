# AI-stock-prediction
This project will attempt to use Artificial Intelligence (through an assortement of LSTM, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model with a Convolutional Neural Network as a discriminator) to predict stock price movement.

The GAN model utilizes Bayesian Optimisation and Reinforcement learning (RL) for deciding when and how to change hyperparameters. The input data consists of historical prices, technical indicators, Fourier Transformer for extracting overall trend directions, as well as sentiment analysis from news report about the stock.
